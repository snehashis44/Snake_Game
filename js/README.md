# Folder Description
The "js" folder contains a collection of JavaScript files that collectively create and manage a browser-based game.
## File Description
These files work together to provide different aspects of the game's functionality and structure. Here's a breakdown of each file's role within the "js" folder:

<br />

- `index.js`: This file sets up an Express.js web server to serve static files from a "public" directory and provides a route to display an "index.html" file.
> This file serves as the entry point for the web application. It sets up an Express.js web server, enabling static file serving from a "public" directory. Additionally, it defines a route to display the "index.html" file. This file establishes the foundation for launching the game through the web server.

<br /> 

- `Snake.js`: This file defines a Snake class in JavaScript, used within a Phaser game scene, to implement the game logic for controlling a snake's movement, collision detection with an apple, boundaries, and self-collision.
> This file encapsulates the game logic for snake-based gameplay within a Phaser game scene. It defines the behavior of the snake, including movement, collision detection with apples, boundaries, and self-collision. The Snake class serves as a core component of the game's mechanics, ensuring a challenging and interactive player experience.

<br />

- `singlephase.js`: This file configures and initializes a Phaser game with a specified size and scene, using the "Mainscene.js" file for the main gameplay logic and rendering. The game is set to determine the rendering context automatically, and it's attached to an HTML element with the id "phaser-game."
> Responsible for configuring and initializing a Phaser game instance. It sets the game's dimensions and scene structure, including the integration of the "Mainscene.js" file. This file is instrumental in establishing the visual and interactive framework for the game.

<br />

- `Mainscene.js`: This file defines a Phaser game scene called "Mainscene" where a Snake game is implemented. The scene creates an instance of the Snake class, which handles the snake's behavior. The `create` method initializes the Snake object, and the `update` method is called on every game frame, updating the Snake's state based on the elapsed time.
> Defines the main game scene "Mainscene" using Phaser. It leverages the Snake class to create and manage the snake's behavior within the game. The create method initializes the game elements, and the update method manages the game's continuous dynamics, ensuring smooth gameplay.
